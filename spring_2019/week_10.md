## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I was able to get a database set up for the indexing component which is essentially the first database for the system that allows the system to shut down without losing everything that it has already done. This database was implemented with PostgreSQL.

## This Week's Plan

The next step in this process is ironing out bugs with the crawling system. A lot of information is not being added to the new database and a lot of junk links are being accessed by the crawler and we need to figure out why.

## Anything Blocking?

Not really.
