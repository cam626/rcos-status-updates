## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I worked on general logic bugs in how the webcrawl system determines where to go and filters out bad links through link validation. This is still going to need more work but it will do for now. I also looking into what libraries I could use to visualize the webgraph that the webcrawler is constructing for debugging purposes.

## This Week's Plan

This coming week I plan to work on data storage so that the webcrawler can be restarted without losing any data. The beginning of an implementation is there with MongoDB but I want to move away from that because I do not believe that we need a full database service running for the small amount of data that needs to be stored.

## Anything Blocking?

Not really.
