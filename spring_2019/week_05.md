## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I started to read the Text-Transformation component of the system and attempted to get it up and running. To do this, I needed to determine all of the dependencies and get my system setup. I ended up crawling through a wormhole of packages to eventually find the ones that I needed.

## This Week's Plan

The Text-Transformation component should be documented this week so that I and future developers can understand what is going on. 

## Anything Blocking?

Not really.
