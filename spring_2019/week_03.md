## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I added a timestamp feature to track the times that the crawler accesses a webpage so that we can easily prevent cycles as well as abide by the politeness policy.

## This Week's Plan

In the coming week I would like to add a feature to confine the domains that the crawler is able to reach. This should still allow the search engine to index webpages from news sites and social media.

## Anything Blocking?

I need to figure out a way to restrict the accessible domains while still reaching anything related to RPI. I don't have many ideas for this yet but I may do something along the lines of having a seed URL in each domain that we expect to be important so that we theoretically hit a minimum of all of those pages.
