## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I worked on getting a database set up to store information about the state of the crawling system and keep track of the information that it obtained up to its current point. I don't have it up and working yet because I don't have much familiarity with MongoDB, which is the database that I chose to work with.

## This Week's Plan

This week I will continue to work on the database and should be able to get something at least running and functional. I also want to start working on some kind of demo for the upcoming presentation.

## Anything Blocking?

Not really.
