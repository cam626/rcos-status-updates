## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I fixed the communication between the Crawler and the Text Transformation components which completes the backend loop. This now actively crawls the internet to find new documents and updates our webgraph.

## This Week's Plan

Now that we are actively crawling the web we need to clean the data that we are getting more. A lot of the links that were found are invalid or not even links which we need to filter out. We also need to limit the crawling to domains that we think are relevant to RPI.

## Anything Blocking?

Not really.
