## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I spent my time fixing bugs that were exposed by the testing suite that I created. One of the more significant bugs was a segmentation fault that was caused by a lack of conditionals surrounding important statements. This segmentation fault occurred when the program attempted to process a queue that was empty.

## This Week's Plan

In the coming week I will start working on the Text-Transformation component, which will take a lot of reading because it is not very well documented by the previous programmer.

## Anything Blocking?

Poor documentation by previous developers has made me spend a lot of time trying to understand previous code.
