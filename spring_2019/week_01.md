## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I was able to successfully integrate the Link-Analysis component API with that of the Crawler. This is a crucial step because it is the first pair of components that are connected. 

## This Week's Plan

I will continue to work on linking each component together, starting with the backend loop consisting of Link-Analysis, Crawling, and Text Transformation. I will also hopefully setup 404 timeouts in the WebGraph to track broken URLs and possibly even write a custom JSON parser to decrease the number of dependencies we have on external libraries. 

## Anything Blocking?

The initial connection between the two hosts was difficult to debug and caused for some frustration but after the problem was realised it was an easy thing to fix.
