## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I created an automated testing suite in Python to more easily and quickly test new features and ensure that I didn't break anything.This testing suite works by sending a variety of POST requests to the component and checking to see if the response is what it's supposed to be. This could be more effective and accurate if it also tested the internals of the component.

## This Week's Plan

I would like to figure out a way to make the test cases more comprehensive and complete. Also this may be the week that we get the back loop connected and running so there will be debugging that needs to be done.

## Anything Blocking?

I am waiting on the other components to get up and running before we can do more integration. I also don't know exactly what the best way of testing the entire application is other than the POST request method that I am currently using.
