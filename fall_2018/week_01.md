## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week was used as an introduction to the codebase and a reintroduction to using Swift.

## This Week's Plan

This week I am going to have heart surgery so I wont be able to do anything.

## Anything Blocking?

Swift is very different from the structure of languages that I know so it is a little more difficult to learn than I expected.

## Notes
