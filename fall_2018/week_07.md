## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.
Last week I started to implement how the error system interfaces with the view controllers.
This involved creating a property, which in swift is an observable variable, and updating the view
when the property changes.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.
This coming week I want to change the way that the application navigation works.
Currently a user has to scroll through a vertical menu opened through a menu button and this has proven
cumbersome. The new navigation will most likely put most if not all of the data in a single view
to act as more of a discovery application rather than a reference application.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.
I don't fully understand the heirarchy that view controllers use in iOS development which makes it
difficult to know how to access different views and data.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

## Notes
