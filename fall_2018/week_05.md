## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.
Last week I was able to implement the beginning of an error suite that fetches error
messages from the S3 server.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.
This week I am going to continue to work on the error suite by applying it to more situations and
externalizing it to a function.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.
I didn't really have any blockers this week.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

## Notes
