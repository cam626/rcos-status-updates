## Last Week's Accomplishments

Over the last two weeks I had to take a step back with the error system that I was making because there was a discrepancy with what the functionality was supposed to accomplish.

## This Week's Plan

This week I want to begin implementing the new design features that our design member has come up with which include implementing a new icon set as well as redesigning the flow of the application to avoid hard to reach areas and useless menus.

## Anything Blocking?

This week I had an issue with the repository when another member of the team did a very large refactor which affected the functionality of what I had written. This caused me to have to rewrite my portion to work with the new version of the app after I fixed the merge conflicts.
