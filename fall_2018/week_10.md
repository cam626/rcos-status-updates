## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I finally finished the error system which now helps keep the user informed about what is going wrong as well as lets use block use of the app by setting a flag on the server. This would be needed for cases like setting up the information for a new semester and not wanting to release it yet.

## This Week's Plan

This week I want to try to make calendar exports add directly into the calendar app. This should be simple if it is possible because all of the necessary data is gathered and the method should be well documented online.

## Anything Blocking?

This week was fairly smooth sailing without many problems.
